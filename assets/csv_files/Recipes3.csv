In a medium size sauce pan; stir in the sugar and water with heat on medium.

Take few tablespoons of water in a cup; add a drop of sugar syrup to water.

With the heat on medium continue stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.In 10 to 15 minutes, the mixture will thicken and will come away from the sides of the pan.

The sugar will crystallise making the burfi very hard.Transfer the coconut burfi mixture to a tray (8 x 8 inch square which has a 2 inch min height) greased with ghee. �Level the burfi mixture.
